These are Font Awesome 5.0 icons, which we have a customized system to import
into templates so that we can avoid using JavaScript.

To use an icon, first copy the SVG here and strip the license[1]. Then add this
to your template:

    {{icon("caret-right")}}

[1] Note, we add the license back again later.
